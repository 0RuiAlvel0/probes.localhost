  <H1>Install probe side</H1>
  <center><a href="index.html">Back to main</a> | <a href="server.html">Server setup</a></center>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Navigate to the probes_sw folder. That folder contains the scripts used for the probe to
      collect network information. This is also how you can make your own scripts
      to collect your own data.
    </li>
  <li>
    You need to have a device that is running linux and that you have connected to the network
    you would like to to analyze. ssh on to it.
  </li>
    <li>
      I assume tthe probes_sw directory is on your local machine and you want to send it over to the
      machine you're ssh'ed to. From the local machine and if your $PWD is where the probes_sw directory is:
      scp -r probes_sw remote_user@remote_ip:destination_directory. Usually the destination_directory
      will be /home/username.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the probe and after you transfer the probes_sw directory, go to probes_sw/data and do nano config.data.
      Change only SERVER_1=http://the_server_ip
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes on the development environment: you can run the server and the probes software on the same machine.
      For me, I have a ubuntu guest on a windows host machine. The linux machine is running both the server and
      the probe software. From this point onwards, I will set the system up using this assumption. I had to
      edit the sites-enabled/000-default.conf file to include the following line: <br />
      DocumentRoot /var/www/probes.localhost/probes_sw/web so that when the probe contacts localhost the probe webserver
      is served. Make sure the probe has curl, jq (sudo apt-get install jq), nodejs and apache installed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to probes_sw/data and do nano config.data. Change the server_1 variable to http://probes.localhost.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now you need to add the probe on the server. At this moment in time (May 2021), you need to delete the
      existing probes directly from the database. The delete button doesn't yet work. Go to the database, possibly
      using mySQL or any other mySQL client.Go to the probes table and delete the two rows there. If you Now
      refresh the probes list it will say "There's nothing in here."<br />
      Click the +Probe button and enter the mac address of the wired and wireless interfaces or whichever
      interface you have available. if you only have one, enter 00:00:00:00:00:00. You can get that information by doing ifconfig -a.<br />
      You will get something like this: Your wired write key is bekzzs Your wireless write key is ewfqp0.
      Make a note of that.
    </li>
    <li>
      Edit the probe you just created (click the blue gear button for that probe on the list) and change
      the configuration server to http://probes.localhost
    </li>
    <li>Install a crontab (issue the command crontab -e) with the contents that
      <a href="https://github.com/commacmms/probes.localhost/issues/1" target="_blank">you can see here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      At the end of this long adventure, you should have the server online on the probes lists. that
      means the probe can successfuly talk to the server. We now need to work on getting the tests running
      and reporting data.
    </li>
  </ul>
