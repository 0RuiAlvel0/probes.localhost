  <H1>Project description</H1>
  Open Nemo is a set of software tools split into a server side and network client side part.
  The basic idea is to deploy the probe(s) on the network, have them collect
  network quality parameters and then report that information back to the server which
  stores the collected information and displays the current network status.
  <H1>Before you start</H1>
  It is assumed the user has some experience seting up a linux environment including
  apache, mysql, php, stuff like that. The installation instructions below start from the
  point where you already have a apache server running including support for php and
  mysql. You will also need a way to setup mysql users and databases. I did this on a
  linux server, I see no reason why this wouldn't work on a windows machine but I have not tried it.
  The previous comments are for the server side software. The probe side software
  is for linux based machines only. You can run it on a raspberry pie (although consider
  any potential caps on network speeds as you will not be able to test the full speed range
  if the probe cannot use Gb ethernet, for example).<br />
  IMPORTANT ensure you have the mod_rewrite module installed in apache.
  <H1>Install server side</H1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/commacmms/probes.localhost" target="_blank">
      Download the code from github</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Place the contents of the downloaded folder to /var/www/probes.localhost or wherever
    you are going to serve your files from. You can delete the contents of the docs folder. That is
    only the files for howto you can get online.</li>
    <li>
      Open config/database.php, scroll down and set yout localhost, username,
      password and database. This is what you want it to be, you will setup all of this up
      later. You can leave that information as is if you would like. The instructions
      that follow assume you made no changes to the information on this file. Be careful
      if you are going to run this on a production machine. You will want to change this information
      in that case.
    </li>
    <li>
      Setup the server database:<br />
      1) Open a terminal window and enter mysql as root: "sudo mysql"
      (you will have to create a new user and a new database).<br />
      2) CREATE DATABASE zodiak_app;
      3) Now create a new user: CREATE USER 'zodiak_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_db_password';<br />
      4) GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'zodiak_app'@'localhost'; //actually requesting access to all dbs.
      You may want to limit this to only the database you just created.<br />
      5) FLUSH PRIVILEGES;<br />
      6) Copy the provided database to this new database you just created: <br />
      mysql -u zodiak_app -p -h localhost zodiak_app < /var/www/probes.localhost/zodiak_app.sql<br />
      Replace /var/www/probes.localhost/zodiak_app.sql with the path where you have the database file.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should now be able to go to https://probes.localhost and should see the login form.
      <br />
      <img src="images/login_screen.png"><br />
      Enter "info@yourserver.com" as username and "test" as password to login. You should now be taken to the
      dashboard which looks something like this:<br />
      <img src="images/dashboard.png"><br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <H1>Install probe side</H1>
